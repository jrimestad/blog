Choice
______
Trying to find a suitable theme for my blog / project list site. Its not that easy. Either they seem too simple like [minima:https://github.com/jekyll/minima] or they are far too complex like [so-simple-theme:https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme]

Have been through quite at few nice though like [jalpc:http://www.jack003.com/#page-top].

Think I will give [folio*:https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/38846927/-folio] a try.
